# This whole repo is against Google Colab policy and you shouldn't be using it.

> **Why are hardware resources such as T4 GPUs not available to me?**
> The best available hardware is prioritized for users who use Colaboratory interactively rather than for long-running computations. Users who use Colaboratory for long-running computations may be temporarily restricted in the type of hardware made available to them, and/or the duration that the hardware can be used for. We encourage users with high computational needs to use Colaboratoryâ€™s UI with a local runtime.
> Please note that using Colaboratory for cryptocurrency mining is disallowed entirely, and may result in being banned from using Colab altogether.
